# Find a Github user's favourite coding language
A technical test set by Unboxed.co

A demo hosted on Heroku can be found [here](https://frozen-springs-45520.herokuapp.com/).

## How it works
It's a very simple app that queries Github's public API to obtain information on
a user's public repositories.

Each repository has a 'language' which represents which language has primarily
been used in that repository.

This app takes that information and counts which language is most popular for
the user specified.
